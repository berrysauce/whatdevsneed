## Introduction
I made whatdevsneed.com to share a list of curated developer tools with others. I try to list tools that not everyone knows, but of course it's possible that you know a few. I also wanted to create a website, where you can do exactly this without any annoying ads or marketing going on. Tools on whatdevsneed are not sponsored by any company to rank higher. They're randomly mixed on each load of the website.

## Add your favourite tool(s)
If you have anything to share, feel free to head over to https://www.whatdevsneed.com/add and add your favourite developer tools.
